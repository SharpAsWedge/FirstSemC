In this folder I have the source codes only for all the projects I did using Dev C++ when I was struggling to use Visual Studio Code for whatever reason. But this has a separate folder because when I started using VS Code I just created a new folder and started my new projects on that one. So you may even consider this am younger and less informed me creating C Programs in the .cpp extension.
I expected this folder to have more files because I originally saw like 15 of them in the first viewing. Turns out half of them were executables and among the remaining 8, 4 were projects I had copied from the internet for testing and rest 2 were almost empty.
I'm surprised I don't have a Hello World file in here.
It's probably because I did that program in the Lab pc instead of my laptop.
Alright see you in other folders!
