# FirstSemC
This repository will hold all the projects I've made in the first semester, whether big or small in C lang.
One folders will contain the things I did in the part of classroom learning (basically the ones I wrote in Dev++ and so they appear as .cpp)
and other will include the ones I did out of curiosity. The programs which didn't work have not been included however.
I will be making more projects along the way and add it to the past First sem folder when I have enough time
I also have C++ in the next semester so I don't know if I can have enough time for more C projects after this
