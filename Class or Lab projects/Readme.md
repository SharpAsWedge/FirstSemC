In this folder I have the source codes only for all the projects I did using Dev C++ when I was struggling to use Visual Studio Code for whatever reason. But this has a separate folder because when I started using VS Code I just created a new folder and started my new projects on that one. So you may even consider this am younger and less informed me creating C Programs in the .cpp extension.
